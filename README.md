During my internship at BhumiiTech I have been actively involved in the
development and implementation of an attack and simulation framework. My
primary focus has been on studying and applying the MITRE ATT&CK
framework and exploring the functionalities of the Atomic Red Team testing
suite.
To begin, I conducted in-depth research on the MITRE ATT&CK framework, a
comprehensive knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques. I
familiarized myself with its structure, sub-techniques, and the associated threat
groups. This enabled me to understand the landscape of modern cyber threats
and the various attack vectors used by adversaries. Building upon my
knowledge of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, I delved into the Atomic Red
Team project, an open-source testing suite designed to validate the
effectiveness of security controls and identify potential weaknesses in an
organization's defences. I thoroughly studied the documentation, including the
available test cases and methodologies, to gain a solid understanding of how to
simulate different attack techniques.
In order to gain practical experience, I successfully installed the Atomic Red
Team framework on my Windows and kali Linux desktop machine. This involved
setting up the necessary dependencies, configuring the environment, and
ensuring compatibility with the target operating system. By doing so, I gained
hands-on experience in utilizing the framework and executing simulated
attacks within a controlled environment. Throughout this process, I
documented my findings, observations, and any challenges encountered during
the installation and usage of the Atomic Red Team framework. I also noted
potential improvements and recommendations for optimizing its usability and
functionality
